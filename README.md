blackbody
=========

Color from hot things. Creating ColorLookups in Nuke using real blackbody radiation data.

In the Nuke Script Editor:

import blackbody
blackbody.addMenu()

That will add a "Blackbody" menu to the Nodes panel. From there, you're on your own. Using actual scientific data to make art never works quite as you'd expect -- ask any FX artist. Good luck.
